# My Minor Modifications

This is where I put small `*.vim` files that are slightly larger than I like in my `.vimrc`, or that I might want to keep separate for any other reason.

Most I probably put under `start` to load them automatically, but another way of doing things is to put them undder `opt` and put `runtime /path/to/file.vim` in the `.vimrc` , which then additionally creates a record of the change in the `.vimrc` where most people would look for it.
